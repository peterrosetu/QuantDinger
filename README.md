## What Is QuantDinger?

QuantDinger is a **self-hosted AI trading platform** and **quant research workspace** for teams and operators who want one system for:

- AI market analysis
- Python indicator and strategy development
- backtesting and strategy persistence
- live trading execution
- portfolio monitoring and alerts
- multi-user operations, billing, and commercialization

If you are searching for an **open source quant platform**, **AI trading research stack**, **self-hosted backtesting system**, or **natural-language-to-Python strategy workflow**, this is what QuantDinger is built for.

## Why QuantDinger

- **Self-hosted by design**: your credentials, strategy code, market workflows, and operational data stay under your control.
- **Research to execution in one product**: AI analysis, charting, strategy logic, backtests, quick trade, and live operations are connected.
- **Python-native and AI-assisted**: write indicators and strategies directly in Python, or use AI to accelerate drafting and iteration.
- **Built for operators, not just demos**: Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, health checks, worker toggles, and environment-based configuration.
- **Commercialization-ready**: memberships, credits, admin management, and USDT payment flows are already part of the stack.

## Who It Is For

- **Traders and quants** who want AI-assisted market research without giving up control of infrastructure and data.
- **Python strategy developers** who want charting, backtests, and live execution in one environment.
- **Small teams and studios** building internal trading tools or private research platforms.
- **Operators and founders** who need a deployable product with user management, billing, and admin controls.

## What You Can Do With QuantDinger

### AI Research and Decision Support

- Run fast AI-driven market analysis across price action, kline structure, macro/news context, and selected external inputs.
- Store analysis history and memory for repeatable review and future calibration.
- Configure multiple LLM providers such as OpenRouter, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, and more.
- Optionally enable ensemble and calibration-style flows for more robust AI outputs.

### Indicator and Strategy Development

- Build `IndicatorStrategy` workflows for dataframe-based signals, chart overlays, and signal backtests.
- Build `ScriptStrategy` workflows for stateful runtime logic, explicit order control, and live execution alignment.
- Generate indicator or strategy code from natural language and refine it in Python.
- Visualize indicators, buy/sell signals, and strategy output directly on professional chart interfaces.

### Backtesting and Iteration

- Run historical backtests with stored trades, metrics, and equity curves.
- Backtest both indicator-driven logic and saved strategy records.
- Persist strategy snapshots and review historical runs for reproducibility.
- Use AI-assisted post-backtest analysis to improve parameters and execution assumptions.

### Live Trading and Operations

- Connect crypto exchanges through a unified execution layer.
- Use quick-trade flows to go from analysis to action faster.
- Monitor open positions, review trade history, and close positions from the platform.
- Run automated or semi-automated strategy workflows with runtime services and workers.

### Multi-Market Coverage

- Crypto spot and derivatives
- US stocks through IBKR
- Forex through MT5
- Prediction market research through Polymarket analysis workflows

### Multi-User, Alerts, and Billing

- Natural language to strategy code and config scaffolding
- Better fit for traders who know the idea they want, but want to accelerate implementation

### Analysis Memory and Review

- Historical analysis storage
- Better repeatability and comparison over time
- A foundation for future calibration and reflection loops

### Ensemble, Calibration, and Reflection

- Optional multi-model ensemble configuration
- Confidence calibration and reflection-style worker support
- Better operational path for teams that want more stable AI-assisted workflows

### AI-Assisted Backtest Feedback

- Backtest outputs can feed into AI-generated suggestions
- Useful for parameter tuning, risk adjustments, and faster iteration

### Polymarket and Cross-Market Research

- Analyze prediction markets as a research workflow
- Compare AI view versus market-implied probabilities
- Surface divergence and opportunity scoring

## Why It Is Different

Most trading stacks give you one or two of these pieces. QuantDinger aims to give you the full operating system:

1. **Self-hosted infrastructure**
2. **AI research workflows**
3. **Python strategy development**
4. **Backtesting**
5. **Live execution**
6. **Portfolio and notification operations**
7. **Commercialization primitives**

That combination is the core difference.

## How It Works

At a practical level, QuantDinger runs as a self-hosted application stack:

- a prebuilt Vue frontend served by Nginx
- a Flask API backend with Python services
- PostgreSQL for state, users, strategies, and history
- Redis for worker support and runtime coordination
- exchange, broker, AI, payment, and notification integrations through configurable adapters

### Architecture Summary

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Prebuilt Vue application served by Nginx |
| Backend | Flask API, Python services, strategy runtime |
| Storage | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Cache / worker support | Redis 7 |
| Trading layer | Exchange adapters, IBKR, MT5 |
| AI layer | LLM provider integration, memory, calibration, optional workers |
| Billing | Membership, credits, USDT TRC20 payment flow |
| Deployment | Docker Compose with health checks |

### Execution Model

- Market data is pulled through a pluggable data layer.
- Backtests run on the server-side strategy engine, including strategy snapshot handling.
- Live strategies run through runtime services that generate order intent.
- Pending orders are then dispatched through exchange-specific execution adapters.
- Crypto live execution is intentionally separated from market-data collection concerns.

## Quick Start

> Requirement: install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Node.js is not required for deployment because this repository already includes the prebuilt frontend in `frontend/dist`.

### Linux / macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger.git
cd QuantDinger
cp backend_api_python/env.example backend_api_python/.env
./scripts/generate-secret-key.sh
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger.git
cd QuantDinger
Copy-Item backend_api_python\env.example -Destination backend_api_python\.env
$key = py -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
(Get-Content backend_api_python\.env) -replace '^SECRET_KEY=.*$', "SECRET_KEY=$key" | Set-Content backend_api_python\.env -Encoding UTF8
docker-compose up -d --build
```

After startup:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:8888`
- Backend health check: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`
- Default login: `quantdinger` / `123456`

Important deployment notes:

- The backend container will **not start** if `SECRET_KEY` still uses the default value.
- The main application config lives in `backend_api_python/.env`.
- Root `.env` is optional and is mainly used for image mirrors or custom ports.
- The default stack includes `frontend`, `backend`, `postgres`, and `redis`.

### Common Docker Commands

```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose restart backend
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose down
```

### Optional Root `.env`

If you need custom ports or image mirrors, create a root `.env`:

```ini
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
BACKEND_PORT=127.0.0.1:5001
IMAGE_PREFIX=docker.m.daocloud.io/library/
```

### Prediction Markets

Polymarket is currently supported as a **research and analysis workflow**, not as direct in-platform live execution. It is useful for market lookup, divergence analysis, opportunity scoring, and AI-assisted review.

## Strategy Development Modes

QuantDinger supports two main strategy authoring models:

### IndicatorStrategy

- dataframe-based Python scripts
- `buy` / `sell` signal generation
- chart rendering and signal-style backtests
- best for research, indicator logic, and visual strategy prototyping

### ScriptStrategy

- event-driven `on_init(ctx)` / `on_bar(ctx, bar)` scripts
- explicit runtime control with `ctx.buy()`, `ctx.sell()`, `ctx.close_position()`
- best for stateful strategies, execution-oriented logic, and live alignment

For the full developer workflow, see:

- [Strategy Development Guide](docs/STRATEGY_DEV_GUIDE.md)
- [Cross-Sectional Strategy Guide](docs/CROSS_SECTIONAL_STRATEGY_GUIDE_EN.md)
- [Strategy Examples](docs/examples/)
